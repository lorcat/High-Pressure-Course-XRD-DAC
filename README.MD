## Purpose
This short course provided in a form of slides. It is intended for students studying high pressure with a focus on X-ray diffraction.
It shortly covers the principles of X-ray diffraction, information hidden in the signal, with an inclination to working with samples subjected to high pressures. It briefly covers large volume techniques with a shift of focus to the diamond anvil (DAC) technique and the effects of high pressure environments. A brief introduction to the signal from samples of powder and single crystalline form is given.

## Additional information
The course contained practical work with Crysalis, Jana2006 and other software. This additional content is not available at the git-hub at the moment.

I hope that the current and the future students will find some answers related to the typical high pressure diamond anvil experiment.
